# CRACKME TUTORIAL

Welcome to the Crackme Tutorial repository! Here you will find a collection of crackme files for you to practice your reverse engineering skills.

## What crackme files are
* These crackme files are special executables, coded with c and secured with a password that are designed to be "cracked" or reverse engineered. 
* They are often used as a way to test and improve reverse engineering skills. 
* These particular files specifically have security flaws that can allow even beginners to crack them easily.

## How to use crackme files
* To use these files, simply download the desired file and use your reverse engineering tools and techniques to attempt to "crack" the file. 
* The goal is usually to find the correct input or sequence of inputs that will allow the program to execute fully.

## Disclaimer
* Please note that these files are for educational purposes only and should not be used for any illegal activities. 
* Use of these files is at your own risk.

I hope you find these files useful in your journey to improve your reverse engineering skills!
